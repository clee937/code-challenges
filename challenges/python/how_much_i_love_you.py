# CodeWars Challenge: [How much I love you]
# Link: [https://www.codewars.com/kata/57f24e6a18e9fad8eb000296/train/python]
# Difficulty: [8 Kyu]

# Instructions
# Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:

# "I love you"
# "a little"
# "a lot"
# "passionately"
# "madly"
# "not at all"

# If there are more than 6 petals, you start over with "I love you" for 7 petals, "a little" for 8 petals and so on. Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say at the last petal for a flower of a given number of petals. The number of petals is always greater than 0.

# list
def how_much_i_love_you(nb_petals):
    phrases = ["I love you", "a little",
               "a lot", "passionately", "madly", "not at all"]

    return phrases[(nb_petals-1) % len(phrases)]
